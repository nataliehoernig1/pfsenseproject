 ### [Video Demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bcqGCB0KK-U4kqeQ-cWInySd7fyfdmq3/view?usp=sharing)

<h2>Description</h2>
This was a final project I completed for my Firewalls and Network Security course. We were required to demonstrate how you would configure certain settings within PfSense. 
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PfSense Firewall</b> 

<h2>The list of configurations were as follows:</h2>

- <b>Reset your PFSense security appliance back to factory defaults via Diagnostics/Factory Default</b>
- <b>Change the default admin password "pfsense" to "WildRed226." (Keep in mind that a strong password is always needed.)</b>
- <b>Create a user account with your username/password/Full name and adding that account to the admins group</b>
- <b>Create at least 2 firewall rules and test the rules to make sure they work.</b>
- <b>Configure your PFSense appliance Dashboard to only have the following widgets: System Information, Interfaces, Gateways, Traffic Graphs (WAN/LAN), and Firewall Logs.</b>
